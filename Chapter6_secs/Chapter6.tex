\chapter{The evolution of BECs in disordered potentials}

In this chapter, we report the experimental study of the evolution of BECs in disordered potentials. In Sec.~(\ref{optical_design}), we present the optical design diagrams of both the speckle beam and the Raman beams which are used to generate spin-orbit coupling as discussed in Sec.~(\ref{soc}). And we discuss the reasons behind these designs. In Sec.~(\ref{speckle_pulsing}), we show the experimental results of the evolution of BECs under the pulses of speckle potentials, both in the short term and in the long term. Based on our analytical study and numerical simulations, we show the results of characterizing the PSD of the speckle potentials by using the short-term speckle pulses data and measuring the average speckle potential by using the long-term speckle pulses data. In Sec.~(\ref{transport}), we measure the deceleration of spinless BECs in the speckle potentials and compare them with our simulation results shown in Ch. (\ref{chpt 5}).
