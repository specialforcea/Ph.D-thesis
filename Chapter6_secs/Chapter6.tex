\chapter{The evolution of BECs in disordered potentials: Experiments}

In this chapter, we report the experimental study of the evolution of BECs in disordered potentials. In Sec.~(\ref{optical_design}), we present the optical design diagram of both the speckle beam and the Raman beams. And we discuss the logic behind these designs. In Sec.~(\ref{speckle_pulsing}), we show the experimental results for the evolution of BECs under speckle potential pulses, both in short-term and in long-term. Based on our analytical study and numerical simulation, we show the results of characterizing the PSD of the speckle potential by using short-term speckle pulses data and measuring the average speckle potential by using the long-term speckle pulses data. In Sec.~(\ref{transport}), we measure the deceleration of spinless BECs in speckle potentials and compare with our simulation results shown in chapter (\ref{chpt 5}).
