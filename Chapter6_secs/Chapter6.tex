\chapter{Enhanced transport of SOC Bose gases in disordered potentials: Experiment}

In this chapter, we report the experimental study of enhanced transport of SOC Bose gases in disordered potentials. First, we present the optical design diagram of both the speckle beam and the Raman beams. And we discuss the logic behind these designs. Next, we show the experimental results for characterizing the optical potentials with cold atoms. For speckle beams, we use the pulsing technique to measure the average potential depth and characterize it with the beam intensity. For the Raman beams, we ... Finally, we report the measurement of transport in both spinless and SOC cases, and demonstrate SOC can dramatically enhance the transport of SOC states predicted in theory in Chpt.~(\ref{chpt 5}).
