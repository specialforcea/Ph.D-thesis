\section{Evolution of spinless BEC under speckle pulsing}\label{speckle_pulsing}
In Ch.~(\ref{speckle_chapter}), we derived a Gaussian beam model of the speckle beam and calculated the field-field correlation function, the PSD, and the intensity distribution. In the experiments, the engineered speckle beam is focused at the atoms and it is hard to directly measure the average intensity of the speckle beam at the atoms. Direct measurements of the PSD and $k_c$ is even harder. In some experiments carried out previously that involved a speckle beam \cite{kondov2011three, billy2008direct}, the researchers set up an identical beam at the test bench and measure the average intensity and the PSD of the test speckle beam. The power and the PSD of the speckle beam in the experiments are assumed to be the same as those of the test beam, but no direct measurements were done to the best of our knowledge. Inspired by \cite{huckans2009quantum}, we designed and carried out an experiment that allowed us to measure the average intensity and the PSD of the speckle beam by using the evolution of spinless BECs under the speckle potentials.

The absorption images are stacked up horizontally according to the speckle pulse duration.}

In \cite{huckans2009quantum}, the diffraction of a Bose-Einstein condensate from a one-dimensional optical lattice is studied. In very short time,
\begin{equation}
    T_{pulse} \ll t_{RN} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{U_0E_L}} = \frac{T_{ho}}{\pi},
\end{equation}
the atoms are mainly scattered to the $\ket{\pm k_L}$ momentum states. Since in the Raman-Nath approximation, the atoms move by a very small distance, the kinetic energy term in the Hamiltonian is neglected. The atomic momentum changes from $\ket{k=0}$ to $\ket{\pm k_L}$, which corresponds to the nonzero components in the PSD of the lattice potential. This inspires us to measure the PSD of the speckle potential and the cutoff $k_c$ by using the short-term speckle beam pulses.

As the pulse duration increases beyond $t_{RN}$, the apparent edge of the momentum distribution is bounded by a maximum momentum $k_{max}$. The observed value of $k_{max}$ can be used to determine the lattice depth $U_0$,
\begin{equation}
    U_0 = \frac{\hbar^2k_{max}^2}{2M}
\end{equation}
Once the edge of the distribution reaches $k_{max}$, the distribution partially collapses to $\ket{k=0}$ at $T_{ho}/2$. The process approximately repeats itself every $T_{ho}/2$. The collapse and revival phenomena can be qualitatively explained in a classical picture. The atoms released from different positions in a harmonic trap become stationary every half of the period. The collapse and revival are not complete in \cite{huckans2009quantum}, at $T_{ho}/2$ there are always some higher momentum orders remain. The reason is that the lattice potential is not perfectly harmonic. 

In contrast to the lattice pulsing, in the speckle beam pulsing, the speckle potential contains a continuous spectrum of spatial frequency. It is completely anharmonic and no collapse and revival should be expected. For long speckle pulsing time, the momentum states should reach a stationary distribution. By Virial theorem, the kinetic energy of the atoms under this stationary distribution should be half of the average speckle potential. This inspired us to measure the average speckle potential by using the width of the momentum distribution for a long speckle pulsing time.
