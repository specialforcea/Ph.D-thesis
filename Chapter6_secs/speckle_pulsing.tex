\section{Evolution of spinless BEC under speckle pulsing}
In Chapter~(\ref{speckle_chapter}), we derived a Gaussian beam model of the speckle beam and calculated the field-field correlation function, PSD and intensity distribution. In experiment, the engineered speckle beam is focused at the atoms and it is hard to directly measure the average intensity of the speckle beam at the atoms. Direct measurement of the PSD and $k_c$ is even harder. In some experiments carried out in other labs previously, the researchers set up an identical beam at the test bench and measure the average intensity and PSD of the test speckle beam. The power and PSD of the speckle beam in the experiment is assumed to be the same, but no direct measurement was done to the best of our knowledge. Inspired by \cite{huckans2009quantum}, we designed and carried out an experiment that allowed us to measure the average intensity and PSD of the speckle beam using the evolution of spinless BEC under the speckle beam pulses.

In \cite{huckans2009quantum}, as shown in Fig.~(\ref{fig:lattice_pulsing}) the diffraction of a Bose-Einstein condensate from a one-dimensional optical lattice is studied. In very short time,
\begin{equation}
    T_{pulse} \ll t_{RN} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{U_0E_L}} = \frac{T_{ho}}{\pi},
\end{equation}
the atoms are mainly in the $\ket{\pm k_L}$ momentum states. Since in the Raman-Nath approximation, the atoms move by a very small distance and acquires minimal kinetic energy, the kinetic energy term in the Hamiltonian is neglected. The momentum state transfers from $\ket{k=0}$ to $\ket{\pm k_L}$ which corresponds to the nonzero component in the PSD of the lattice potential. This inspires us to measure the PSD of the speckle potential and the cutoff $k_c$ using short term speckle beam pulses.

In Fig.~(\ref{fig:lattice_pulsing}), it shows that as the pulse duration increases beyond $t_{RN}$, the apparent edge of the momentum distribution is bounded by a maximum momentum $k_{max}$. The observed value of $k_{max}$ can be used to determine the lattice depth $U0$,
\begin{equation}
    U_0 = \frac{\hbar^2k_{max}^2}{2M}
\end{equation}
Once the edge of the distribution reaches $k_{max}$, the distribution collapses to $\ket{k=0}$ at $T_{ho}/2$. The process approximately repeats it self every $T_{ho}/2$. The collapse and revival phenomena can be qualitatively explained in a classical picture. Atoms released from different positions in a harmonic trap become stationary every half period. The collapse and revival in Fig.~(\ref{fig:lattice_pulsing}) is not complete, at $T_{ho}/2$ there are always some higher momentum orders remain. The reason is the lattice potential is not perfectly harmonic. In contrast to the lattice pulsing, here in the speckle beam pulsing, the speckle potential contains all the continuous frequency modes. It is completely anharmonic and no collapse and revival should be expected. For long speckle pulsing time, the momentum states dephase and reach a stationary distribution. By Virial theorem, the kinetic energy of the atoms under this distribution is half the average speckle potential. This inspired us to measure the average speckle potential using the width of the momentum distribution for long speckle pulsing time.
