Our experimental sequence start with a BEC held in a cross dipole trap. Immediately after turning off the dipole trap, we pulse the speckle beam for time $\tau$, followed by a time-of-flight (TOF). An absorption image is taken after the TOF. For the data we took, $\tau$ range from $0 {\rm ms}$ to $6 {\rm ms}$. The TOF maps the momentum distribution to the position distribution. So by analysing the optical depth of the images, we can get the momentum distribution of atoms after the speckle pulsing and compute its width from which, the average kinetic energy and average speckle potential depth can be estimated.

Fig.~(\ref{fig:speckle_pulsing}) shows absorption images and the fitted Gaussian width. With TOF, the momentum distribution of atoms after speckle pulsing is mapped to the distribution in space. So the optical depth of the absorption images is proportional to the momentum distribution before TOF. For short time speckle pulsing, the width of the momentum distribution increases rapidly. After $\approx 2 {\rm ms}$, the atoms reach equilibrium under speckle potential and the width of the momentum distribution reaches maximum. The average kinetic energy of the atoms can be calculated from the width of momentum distribution in equilibrium. And by Virial Theorem, the total energy can be calculated and compared with the average speckle potential depth. As Fig.~(\ref{fig:speckle_pulsing})(a) shows, we measure the photodiode reading which is proportional to the power of the speckle beam and the average speckle depth. We fit a line crossing the origin so the average speckle potential can be inferred by the photodiode reading directly.

As our model shows, in short time speckle pulsing, the momentum distribution should be proportional to the speckle potential PSD except for the peak at $k=0$. In Fig.~(\ref{fig:speckle_pulsing})(b), we compute the average momentum distribution in short time for different iris size, with the central peak masked. As iris size changes, the cutoff of the PSD changes and in theory should be measurable by comparing the masked normalized momentum distribution. We measured the momentum distribution for two iris sizes,  $6.5 {\rm mm}$ and $15 {\rm mm}$. In theory, the $k_c$ of the PSD should be $1.3 \kr$ and $1.9 \kr$, respectively. But in our measurement, the difference is not clear due to the noise of our measurement.
