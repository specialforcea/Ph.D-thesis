\section{Anderson Localization}

Anderson Localization (AL), introduced in 1958~\cite{anderson1958absence}, describes the localization of quantum waves in disordered media. Anderson studied the evolution of a wave packet undergoing multiple scattering processes from a random potential and proved the scattered waves can constructively interfere, leading to localization. This general starting point makes AL applicable to many quantum systems including: optical waves in disordered media~\cite{wiersma1997localization,scheffold1999localization,storzer2006observation}, electrons imperfect in crystals~\cite{anderson1958absence} and matter waves in disordered optical potentials~\cite{sanchez2007anderson,billy2008direct,roati2008anderson,kondov2011three}.

After AL was observed in multiple systems, in recent years, the research topic of AL phase transition in many body systems (may body localization) has attracted more attentions \cite{pal2010many,bardarson2012unbounded,schreiber2015observation,nandkishore2015many,choi2016exploring}. When disorder strength is above a critical value, the many body system undergoes a phase transition from thermalizing ergodic phase to a nonergodic phase. And in the nonergodic phase, the initial ordering of the many body system persists, which leads to potential application in quantum information \cite{schreiber2015observation,nandkishore2015many}. 

In this section, we first introduce a simple model from \cite{anderson1958absence} that catches the basic idea of single particle AL. Next, we review the progress of AL in cold atoms.
