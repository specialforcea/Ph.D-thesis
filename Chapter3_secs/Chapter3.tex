\chapter{Spin-Orbit coupling and Anderson Localization in a cold atom system}
The high level of control people have over a cold atoms system makes it an ideal platform to study fundamental  condensed matter physics. In contrast to a condensed matter system where we have little control over the material structure and internal environment of particles, in a cold atoms system, the external potential, coupling between internal states and the interaction between particles can all be artificially engineered in the lab.

Spin-orbit coupling and Anderson localization have been realized and studied in cold atoms over the last decade, connecting cold atoms to more rich and fundamental physics in condensed matters. In this chapter, we briefly review the progress of spin-orbit coupling and Anderson localization in cold atoms on which our research spin-orbit coupling enhanced transport in a random field is based.
