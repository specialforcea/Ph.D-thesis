\chapter{Spin-Orbit coupling and Anderson localization in a cold-atom system}
In contrast to a condensed-matter system where we have little control over the material structure and the internal environment of particles, in a cold-atoms system, the external potential, the coupling between internal states and the interaction between particles can all be artificially engineered in the lab. Using the interaction between atoms and the electromagnetic field, the Hamiltonian of the atoms can be engineered to simulate that of particles in a condensed-matter system. The parameters in the Hamiltonian can be tuned by changing the intensity of the light, frequency of the light, the strength of the electromagnetic field, and etc. The high level of control over a cold-atoms system and the ability to simulate the Hamiltonian of a condensed-matter system make it an ideal platform to study fundamental condensed-matter physics that is otherwise hard to study. 

Spin-orbit coupling and Anderson localization have been realized and studied in cold atoms over the last decade. In this chapter, we briefly review the progress of spin-orbit coupling and Anderson localization in cold atoms on which our research of spin-orbit coupling enhanced transport in a random field is based.
