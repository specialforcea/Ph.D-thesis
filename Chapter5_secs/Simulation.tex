\section{Numerical simulation of GPE}\label{GPE_simulation}

Our single particle FGR results only describe short-time scattering from a disorder potential, they cannot describe the full approach to equilibrium.
To bridge the gap between the FGR and the physical system, we need to account for both higher order scattering processes and interparticle interactions.  In our proposed SOBEC realization all aspects of SOC Hamiltonian and the speckle potential are tunable, making SOBECs an ideal system for exploring enhanced transport in 1D quantum wires.
