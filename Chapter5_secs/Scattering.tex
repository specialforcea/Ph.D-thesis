We now focus on the motion of spin-orbit coupled bosons in a speckle-induced disorder potential.  In this section, we develop a Fermi's golden rule (FGR) approach for scattering from a disorder potential, both with and without SOC, schematically depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:Dispersion relations}.   The first order scattering processes captured by the FGR are possible when a matrix element (here from the disorder potential) can couple energetically degenerate initial and final states (here momentum or quasi-momentum states).  We will see that the strength of this coupling is proportional to the PSD of the speckle potential, an example of which is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Dispersion relations}(a).  As depicted in  Fig.~\ref{fig:Dispersion relations}(b), this implies an absence of scattering for momenta differences larger than the speckle-cutoff $k_c$.  Adding SOC, as in Fig.~\ref{fig:Dispersion relations}(c), can suppress scattering for additional wavevectors.  Because a spin-independent speckle potential has no spin-changing matrix element, the energetically allowed transition at an energy $E/\Er \approx 1$ between states of opposite spin is strongly suppressed.  The following discussion quantifies these observations.
