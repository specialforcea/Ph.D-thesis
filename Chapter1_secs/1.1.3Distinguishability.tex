\subsection{Distinguishability}
For a group of identical quantum particles, their spatial states can overlap at any time. And when they do, the lack of information about their positions and the inability to do measurements without changing their states make it in principle impossible to track the particles.  And thus, in quantum mechanics, identical particles are indistinguishable. This indistinguishability has a fundamental effect on the statistics of quantum particles.
