\subsection{Distinguishability}
For a group of identical particles, their spatial state can overlap at any time, and when they do, the lack of information and inability to do measurement without changing their states make it in principle impossible to track the particle,  and thus in quantum mechanics, identical particles are indistinguishable. This indistinguishability has fundamental effect in the statistics of particles.
