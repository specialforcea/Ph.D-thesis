\chapter{Theoretical description of Bose-Einstein condensate}

This chapter starts from the difference in description of particles between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics, indistinguish-ability and exclusion of identical particles lead to dramatically different statistical properties. More fundamentally, I include some discussion about exchange symmetry and why it is related to particle's spin. Next is the fine structure and hyperfine structure of an atom, atom-light interaction. After that, Laser cooling techniques are introduced followed by many-body description of BEC.
