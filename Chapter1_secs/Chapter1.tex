\chapter{Theoretical description of Bose-Einstein condensate}
This Chapter discusses the fundamental theoretical description of non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and manybody Bose-Einstein condensate. 

The non-interacting BEC section starts from the difference in description of particles between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Indistinguish-ability and the exclusion principle of identical particles lead to dramatically different statistical properties from classical particles. More fundamentally, the exchange symmetry and why it is related to particles' spin are introduced. Next, Bose-Einstein statistics is derived and the consequence of non-interacting BEC is explained.

In the manybody BEC section, the second quantization description of manybody systems is first introduced. Next, Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for scalar and spinor Bosons systems are derived.
