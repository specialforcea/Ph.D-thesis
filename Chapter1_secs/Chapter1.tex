\chapter{Theoretical description of Bose-Einstein condensates}
In this chapter, we discuss the fundamental theoretical description of non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and interacting Bose-Einstein condensates. 

The non-interacting BEC section (Sec. \ref{sec. bec1}) starts from the difference in the description of particles between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Indistinguishability and the exclusion principle of identical quantum particles lead to dramatically different statistical properties from classical particles. Next, I briefly discuss the exchange symmetry along with the reason why it is related to particles' spin. After the discussion of exchange symmetry, I derive Bose-Einstein statistics and discuss how it leads to non-interacting BECs.

In the many-body BEC section (Sec. \ref{sec MB}), I  first introduce the second quantization description of many-body systems. Next, by making the mean-field approximation, I derive the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for scalar and spinor bosonic systems.
