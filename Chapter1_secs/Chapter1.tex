\chapter{Theoretical description of Bose-Einstein condensates}
This chapter discusses the fundamental theoretical description of non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and interacting Bose-Einstein condensates. 

The non-interacting BEC section starts from the difference in the description of particles between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Indistinguishability and the exclusion principle of identical particles lead to dramatically different statistical properties from classical particles. More fundamentally, exchange symmetry is introduced along with the reason why it is related to particles' spin. Next, Bose-Einstein statistics is derived and the consequence of non-interacting BEC is explained.

In the many-body BEC section, the second quantization description of many-body systems is first introduced. Next, the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for scalar and spinor bosonic systems are derived.
