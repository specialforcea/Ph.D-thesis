\chapter{Laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms}

The Nobel Lecture of W.D.Phillips, {\it Laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms} \cite{phillips1998nobel} tells a great story of the development of laser cooling techniques since the late 1970s. It is recommended for readers who not only want to learn the laser cooling techniques but also take a close view of how researchers approach new physics and technology. It is aspiring to learn the mature technology that cold atom researcher uses on a daily basis nowadays results from the intelligence, efforts, and persistent pursuit of the early generations of physicists.    

Laser cooling techniques eventually lead to the observation of BECs in 1995. The first BEC was created by Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman, and co-workers at JILA on 5 June 1995 \cite{anderson1995observation}. They cooled a dilute vapor of approximately two thousand $^{87} {\rm Rb}$ atoms to below 170~ ${\rm nK}$ using laser cooling and magnetic evaporative cooling. About four months later, an independent effort led by Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT condensed $^{23} {\rm Na}$ \cite{davis1995bose}. The observation of BECs won laser cooling pioneers Steven Chu, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, and William D. Phillips the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics. And Cornell, Wieman, and Ketterle won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievements.

After more than twenty years, the research field of cold atoms is prosperous. The development of laser cooling techniques have made it possible to make stable and reliable BECs. The highly controllable optical and magnetic potentials, the tunable interaction between particles, and precision measurement techniques have made the BEC system a great platform for Quantum simulation and Quantum computation. 

In this chapter, we use $^{87} {\rm Rb}$ as an example. Start from its energy levels, its interaction with the light and the magnetic field, and then discuss the laser cooling techniques that are essential to make BECs.
