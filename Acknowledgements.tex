First of all, I would like to thank my parents and grandparents for everything they have done for me, and their love and support. I began to realize how important they are and how much I miss them after I studied in a foreign country for years. 

Next, I would like to thank my Ph.D. advisor, Dr. Ian Spielman. Ian has been a great advisor. Amazingly, he has a solid understanding of both AMO physics and modern technologies of computer science and electrical engineering. He cares about graduate students. He is always patient in our discussions and always tries to explain physics most intuitively. Throughout the years, I learned a lot from him, not just physics, but also being optimistic in the hard times.

During the years, I worked with other members of the RbChip lab. Seiji Sugawa, Francisco Salces-C\'arcoba, Andika Putra, Christopher Billington, and Emine Altuntas, thank you for making RbChip lab an enjoyable place to work. I miss the old times when we can have lunch together, especially after being quarantined at home for half a year in the Covid-19 pandemic.

Lastly, thank you, Yuchen Yang, the girl who makes my life beautiful.
